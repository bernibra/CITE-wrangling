  description: "Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a healthy donor, purchased from AllCells (Catalog no: PB001), 87% viable by Trypan blue stain. PBMCs are primary cells with relatively small amounts of RNA (1pg RNA/cell). The same cDNA was used to generate TCR (vdj_v1_hs_pbmc2_t) and B cell Ig (vdj_v1_hs_pbmc2_b) specific libraries."
