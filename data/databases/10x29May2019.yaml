  description: "Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy donor were stained with a panel of 31 TotalSeq-B antibodies (BioLegend). PBMCs are primary cells with relatively small amounts of RNA (1pg RNA/cell). Libraries were prepared following the Chromium Single Cell 3 Reagent Kits v3 with Feature Barcoding technology for Cell Surface Protein User Guide (CG000185 RevB)."
