  description: "CITE-seq of PBMCs from 8 human donors (A-H), 7 antibodies stained in a titration series with concentrations 5ug (micrograms), 3ug, 1ug, 0.5ug, 0.06ug and 0ug. Donor H does not include ADT and was used to estimate background signal.  8 IgM/IgG isotype controls were used. Samples were pooled in equal proportions including an equal proportion of HEK293T and 3% mouse NIH-3T3 cells as negative controls. Data for other cell hashing experiments with transcriptomic readout is available but not included in this data set."
