  description: "ECCITE-seq - simultaneous assay of TCR, CRISPR, gene expression and surface markers.  Data set includes two experiments: 1. a mixing experiment with human PBMCs (25%) human lymphoma cell lines MyLa (5%) and Sez4 (5%) and mouse NIH-3T3 cells (65%) stained with human and mouse anti-CD29. 2. ECCITE-seq of PBMCs from a healthy human donor and a patient with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). CRISPR and TCR sequencing results are not included in this data set"
