  description: droplet-based cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), measuring cell surface proteins and messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts at the single-cell level, for multimodal analysis of lung tissues from patients with SSc-ILD and healthy controls. Explanted tissue from two SSc-ILD samples and one additional healthy control was used for confirmation of scRNA-seq findings at the transcriptome and epitope level. Separate upper and lower lobe samples were included for each patient with SSc-ILD.
