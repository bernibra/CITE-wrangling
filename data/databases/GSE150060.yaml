  description: 'Single-cell expression of 397 genes at the mRNA level and up to 68
    proteins using oligo-conjugated antibodies (AbSeq) in 43656 primary CD4+ T cells
    isolated from the blood and 31907 CD45+ cells isolated from the blood and matched
    duodenal biopsies. Study participants included: one systemic lupus erythematosus
    (SLE) patient (37-year-old female); one T1D patient (16-year-old male); and, one
    autoantibody-negative healthy donor (14-year-old male). Characterisation of total
    CD45+ immune cells isolated from a paired blood and duodenal biopsy was performed
    in cells isolated from two paediatric coeliac disease (CD) patients with active
    disease: one 5-year-old male with Marsh scale disease score of 3c, and one 15-year-old
    male with Marsh scale disease score of 3b.'
