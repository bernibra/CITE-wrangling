  comments: The adt data does not seem to be available in GSE160251, and the data provided
    in the data source is already normalized. The authors kindly provided the raw
    counts after contacting them by email, and the data should be eventually updated
    in GEO. For the proper processing of the dataset, one needs to download the ADT
    and RNA data for the four partitions. ADT data should be stored under `./supp_protein/`
    as four separate folders. Likewise, the RNA data should be stored in `./supp_rna/`
    in four separate folders. The metadata of the study can be downloaded following
    the data source, and should be stored in `./xtra_metadata/` under the name of `GSE160251.csv`.
