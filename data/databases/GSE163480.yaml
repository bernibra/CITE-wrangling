  description: "\tSimultaneous single cell measurements of nuclear proteins and RNA
    with inCITE-seq, with targeted protein measurements using DNA-conjugated antibodies.
    Single nuclei (n=10,014) of HeLa cells, either untreated or after TNFa treatment,
    were profiled with inCITE-seq targeting the transcription factor p65. Single nuclei
    (n=21,583) of the mouse hippocampus after PBS or kainic acid injection were profiled
    with inCITE-seq targeting TFs p65, c-Fos, and PU.1, as well as the RNA-binding
    protein NeuN."
