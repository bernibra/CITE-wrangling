  comments: The structure of the data is weird as there are two experiments compressed
    as `.tar` files, which in turn are compressed together. Each experiment also has
    two subfolders, one for the raw data and one for the filtered data. That is a
    funky way to store the data, and it is not worth for me to automatize the process
    of uncompressing things down and finding the right directory. Ideally, one should
    download the data from GEO, extract the two experiments by uncompressing the main
    file, and in turn uncompressing the two experiments `pancreas_sort` and `spleen`.
    Then, for ADT data, one should select the data from the `raw_feature_bc_matrix`
    and store it in (`./supp_protein/pancreas_sort/matrix.mtx.gz`; `./supp_protein/pancreas_sort/features.tsv.gz`;
    and `./supp_protein/pancreas_sort/barcodes.tsv.gz`). For the RNA data, one can
    simply hyper link the `./supp_protein` as `./supp_rna`. The file `GSE224767_feature_reference.csv.gz`
    should be stored in `./metadata/`

  description: Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq)
    for studies involving enzymatic digestion of human tissue. We tested epitope susceptibility
    of 92 antibodies commonly used to differentiate immune lineages and cell states
    on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells following treatment with an enzymatic
    digestion cocktail used to isolate islets.
