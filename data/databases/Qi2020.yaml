  comment: "In this particular case, the link works just fine. The problem is that the data is weirdly organized into different folders in a convoluted way, all compressed as a zip file, and its processing cannot be painlessly streamlined in a general manner. To add this dataset, one should first download the zip file, uncompress it, and search for the file `WholeBlood/10X/raw_feature_bc_matrix.h5` and files in `WholeBlood/10X/metadata`, store them in `./supp_protein/Qi_2020_WholeBlood/`. Then, one should search for the file `boneMarrow/10X/raw_feature_bc_matrix.h5` and files in `WholeBlood/10X/metadata`, store them in `./supp_protein/Qi_2020_boneMarrow/`. Finally, create a direct link of `./supp_protein` called `./supp_rna`."
