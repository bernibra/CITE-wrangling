  description: A series of Abseq experiments, in which mononuclear BM cells from hip
    aspirates were labelled with 97-197 oligo-tagged antibodies, followed by targeted
    or whole transcriptome scRNAseq on the Rhapsody platform. For targeted single-cell
    transcriptome profiling, the authors establish a custom panel consisting of 462
    mRNAs covering all HSPC differentiation stages, cell type identity genes, mRNAs
    of surface receptors and additional genes that permit the characterization of
    cellular states. Using this panel, in combination with 97 surface markers, the
    authors analyzed the BM of three young healthy donors, and three aged healthy
    donors. This dataset serves as a reference dataset
