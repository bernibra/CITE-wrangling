  comments: The authors decided to store the data as xlsx files, and I cannot be bothered
    to design a reading function for those. Download "Dataset S1 Resting.xlsx" and
    "Dataset S1 Stimulated.xlsx" and turn each 1st sheet of the xlsx file as "matrix_resting.csv"
    and "matrix_stimulated.csv", respectively. Then turn the 2nd sheet as "metadata_resting.csv"
    and "metadata_stimulated.csv" for each file, respectively. Then, accordingly store
    these files in `./supp_protein/Trzupek_2021_Resting/` and `./supp_protein/Trzupek_2021_Stimulated/`.
    Finally, make a direct link of `supp_protein` named "./supp_rna".

  description: We designed a custom panel to quantify the transcription of 534 genes
    in parallel with the expression of 51 surface protein targets using the BD Rhapsody
    AbSeq single-cell system. We applied this technology to profile 20,656 T and NK
    cells isolated from peripheral blood from an SLE patient with a type I interferon
    (IFN)-induced gene expression signature (IFNhi), and an age- and sex- matched
    IFNlow SLE patient and healthy donor.
