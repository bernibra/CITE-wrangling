  description: CITE-Seq on a single breast cancer case cryopreserved as CT using a
    panel of 15 canonical cell type markers. Samples were stained with 10X Chromium
    3â€² mRNA capture compatible TotalSeq-A antibodies (BioLegend, USA). Staining was
    performed as previously described by Stoeckius et al. (2017).
