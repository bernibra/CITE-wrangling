  comments: "One needs to be signed in to download the data. The adt data is a file named `CITE.zip`, one should download it and inside there will be the different samples as compressed files. Uncompress them and find, for each sample `x` (CID3838; CID4379N; CID4515; CID4040; CID3946), the umi_reads (matrix, barcode and feature files) and store them in `./supp_protein/x/`. For the RNA data, one needs to download `brca_mini_atlas_raw_unfiltered.zip` file, uncompress it and store every sample `x` (three files for matrix, barcodes and features) in `./supp_rna/x/`. Finally, the metadata folder should contain the file `Whole_miniatlas_meta.csv`. Before storing such file in `metadata`, one should also open it in R and create an additional column named `barcode`, with only the barcodes (as the file contains the barcodes and sample information all-toghether as `sample_barcode`)."

In particular, immunophenotyping using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing four samples and performing anchor-based integration to transfer protein expression levels to the remaining cases"
